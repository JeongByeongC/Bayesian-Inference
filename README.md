# Bayesian-Inference

This repository contains MATLAB code for Bayesian inference and modeling, inspired by Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop, 2006) and the research paper “Use It and Improve It or Lose It: Interactions between Arm Function and Use in Humans Post-stroke” by Yukikazu Hidaka et al. The project demonstrates Bayesian parameter estimation for linear equations and extends the concept to function and use models in the context of human behavior and recovery.

## Overview

This repository includes examples and tools for applying Bayesian inference to various models. The primary goal is to provide an understanding of how Bayesian approaches can be applied to infer parameters, assess uncertainty, and model interactions between functional use and recovery dynamics.

### Key Features

  1. Bishop Example:
	 + Demonstrates Bayesian inference for parameter estimation in a linear equation:
      y = w_0 + w_1x
